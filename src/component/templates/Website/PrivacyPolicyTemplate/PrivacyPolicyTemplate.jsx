      <h3>4. Data security and infrastructure</h3>
      <p>We take security seriously. Tap2SOS applies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest)</li>
        <li>Role-based access controls for internal staff</li>
        <li>Data minimisation — only the fields you choose to share are stored</li>
        <li>Blockchain anchoring (optional) — for audit trails and data integrity. The blockchain record contains only hashes (non-identifiable metadata), never personal data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our servers are hosted within the European Economic Area (EEA) in GDPR-compliant facilities.</p>

      <h3>5. Data sharing and third-party processors</h3>
      <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal data. We only share data with selected processors that support our service under strict contractual terms (Data Processing Agreements – DPAs). These may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cloud infrastructure and database hosting providers</li>
        <li>Customer support and ticketing platforms</li>
        <li>Email or notification service providers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All processors act solely under our instructions and comply with GDPR requirements.</p>

      <h3>6. International transfers</h3>
      <p>If data is ever transferred outside the EEA (for example, through global hosting services), we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), or</li>
        <li>Transfers to countries with an adequacy decision.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Data retention</h3>
      <p>Your account and medical profile remain active until you delete them. Once deleted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Account data is permanently removed from our systems within 30 days</li>
        <li>Backups are securely purged within 90 days</li>
        <li>Blockchain metadata remains non-personal and irreversible</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. Your rights under GDPR</h3>
      <p>You have the following rights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access</strong> – to request a copy of your personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Rectification</strong> – to correct inaccuracies.</li>
        <li><strong>Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten")</strong> – to delete your data permanently.</li>
        <li><strong>Restriction</strong> – to limit processing under certain conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Portability</strong> – to receive your data in a structured, machine-readable format.</li>
        <li><strong>Objection</strong> – to processing based on legitimate interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> – at any time, without affecting prior lawful processing.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Security validation</li>
        <li>Language preference</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not use advertising, marketing, or profiling cookies. Anonymous analytics may be collected to improve usability.</p>

      <h3>10. Children's data</h3>
      <p>Tap2SOS is not directed at children under 16. Parents or legal guardians must provide consent before a child's data is registered.</p>

      <h3>11. Updates to this policy</h3>
      <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect legal, technical, or operational changes. If we make material changes, you will be notified via email or a banner on our website. The "Last updated" date will always indicate the current version.</p>

      <h3>12. Complaints and supervisory authority</h3>
      <p>If you believe your data has been processed unlawfully, you may lodge a complaint with your national Data Protection Authority. For Greece, the competent authority is:</p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
